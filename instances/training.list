# DSJ: (From David Johnson (dsj@research.att.com)) Random graphs used in his paper with Aragon, McGeoch, and Schevon, ``Optimization by Simulated Annelaing: An Experimental Evaluation; Part II, Graph Coloring and Number Partitioning'', Operations Research, 31, 378--406 (1991). DSJC are standard (n,p) random graphs. DSJR are geometric graphs, with DSJR..c being complements of geometric graphs.

# Book Graphs. Given a work of literature, a graph is created where each node represents a character. Two nodes are connected by an edge if the corresponding characters encounter each other in the book. Knuth creates the graphs for five classic works: Tolstoy's Anna Karenina (anna), Dicken's David Copperfield (david), Homer's Iliad (homer), Twain's Huckleberry Finn (huck), and Hugo's Les Mis\'erables (jean).

# Game Graphs. A graph representing the games played in a college football season can be represented by a graph where the nodes represent each college team. Two teams are connected by an edge if they played each other during the season. Knuth gives the graph for the 1990 college football season.

# Miles Graphs. These graphs are similar to geometric graphs in that nodes are placed in space with two nodes connected if they are close enough. These graphs, however, are not random. The nodes represent a set of United States cities and the distance between them is given by by road mileage from 1947. These graphs are also due to Kuth.

# SGB: (From Michael Trick (trick@cmu.edu)) Graphs from Donald Knuth's Stanford GraphBase.
# Queen Graphs. Given an n by n chessboard, a queen graph is a graph on n^2 nodes, each corresponding to a square of the board. Two nodes are connected by an edge if the corresponding squares are in the same row, column, or diagonal. Unlike some of the other graphs, the coloring problem on this graph has a natural interpretation: Given such a chessboard, is it possible to place n sets of n queens on the board so that no two queens of the same set are in the same row, column, or diagonal? The answer is yes if and only if the graph has coloring number n. Martin Gardner states without proof that this is the case if and only if $n$ is not divisible by either 2 or 3. In all cases, the maximum clique in the graph is no more than n, and the coloring value is no less than n.
