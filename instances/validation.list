# A graph from the field of computational biology. A tree-decomposition directs a dynamic programming algorithm for protein redesign. The graph comes from ubiquitin, a well studied protein (PDB ID 1ubq).  Each vertex represents a single side chain.  Each edge represents the existence of a pairwise interaction between the two side chains. Copyright Andrew Leaver-Fay

# The vertices of this graph correspond to the squares of an 8 by 8 chessboard. There is an edge between vertices if these are a knights-move away from each other. The origin of this graph can be found in the more than 1000 years old knights-tour puzzle: to find a Hamiltonian path or cycle in this graph.
